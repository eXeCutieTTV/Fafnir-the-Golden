    The following is a translation of The North Wind and the Sun. Each stanza of the story is broken down into 1)
    original text, 2) romanization, 3) gloss, and 4) literal translation. Note a number of interesting Draconic features
    showcased here, such as the Animacy hierarchy, the Recessive case, partial polypersonal agreement, relative clause
    structure, clausal reframing, and nouns changing their gender based on context.
    The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm
    cloak.

    “The sun and the north wind were disputing who is stronger, when a traveler came along within a warm cloak”

    They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger
    than the other.

    “The two agreed whoever succeeds first to cause that the traveler remove his cloak they must be considered stronger”

    Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak
    around him;

    “Then against traveler blew the north wind with its maximal force, but with its stronger force, more tightly he
    surrounds himself within his cloak”

    and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took
    off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.

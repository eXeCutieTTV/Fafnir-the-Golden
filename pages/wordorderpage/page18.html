    The default word order is VSO: verb-subject-object. However, this placement of the verb in this word order is very
    fragile, and sentences will regularly switch to SVO in a number of situations. If a speaker wants to put emphasis on
    the subject of a sentence, they can choose to bring the noun phrase to the front of the sentence. Plus, the verb can
    often come after the subject when it is complemented by an adverb at the beginning of the clause
    (adverb-subejct-verb-object).
    In addition to these optional syntactic switches, there are some situations where VSO is strictly ungrammatical. For
    example, a subject pronoun can never come after the verb it acts upon (though this is rarely a problem since
    Draconic is pro-drop). The same goes for interrogative pronouns, which always precede the verb. Another example is
    when using auxiliary verbs: the auxiliary must come before the subject, and the lexical verb must come after it
    (xSVO word order).

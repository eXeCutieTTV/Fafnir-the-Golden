    Yes or no questions are formed by simply putting the particle syr at the beginning of indicative sentences, with no
    other changes, not even triggering a word order switch. However, all other questions have more difficult formation
    strategies. Henceforth, “all questions” refer to all questions except yes or no questions.
    All questions must be expressed through a noun of some sort. English questions like “how many do you want,” “why are
    you sad,” “when are we arriving,” and “how quickly can you run” must all be rephrased as something like “what number
    do you want,” “for what reason are you sad,” “what time are we arriving,” and “with how much quickness can you run.”
    Note that interrogative pronouns like “what, who, whom” and “which” all qualify as nouns.
    Draconic has two types of interrogative pronouns which all questions use: gendered, and plain. Gendered
    interrogative pronouns work in the same way as a sole “who” or “what” in English: “who wants to eat,” “what is
    that,” etc. These pronouns inflect for all seven genders, so note that “who” referring to dragons and “who”
    referring to humans are different words. Gendered interrogatives simply substitute for the noun in a sentence, but
    always come before the verb. Thus, the sentence order will be SVO or OVS depending on whether the pronoun is the
    subject or object. Different forms are used for the subject and the object (the same difference as who/whom), and
    the agency hierarchy does not apply to interrogatives.
    Plain interrogative pronouns work more like adjectives which describe the noun through which the question is
    expressed. Compare “what did you prepare” with “what meal did you prepare.” The first sentence would use a gendered
    interrogative, but the second sentence would use a plain interrogative. Plain interrogatives do not inflect for all
    7 genders and only differentiate between animate and inanimate. Just like gendered interrogatives, plain
    interrogatives (and the noun they describe) will come before the verb and place the sentence in SVO or OVS. They
    also have different forms for the subject and the object.

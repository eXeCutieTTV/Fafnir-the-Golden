    “Correlatives” refer to a series of pronouns that correspond to each other. They are used in more complex sentence
    structure, such as in questions and subordinate clauses, where the referent must be tracked and kept a consistent
    gender. The full table of correlatives is in the Dictionary (linked in Preface)

    The proximal and distal demonstratives (mentioned in section 3.4) double as demonstrative pronouns, just like
    English “this” and “that.” In addition to frequent deictic use, they also function as conjunctions for verbs that
    take subordinate clauses. In Draconic, verbs with different subjects cannot serialize, so all such sequences of
    multiple verbs are nested within subordinate clauses separated by demonstrative pronouns. For example, English “I
    wish you’d realize he knows she’s smart” would be something like “I wish that you’d realize that he knows that she’s
    smart.” The singular of the demonstrative is always used.
    Both the proximal and distal can be used largely interchangeably, though there are some connotation differences. The
    proximal is more often used for words closer or more related to the subject, and the distal is preferred in
    situations that are not as concrete/not yet realized (a kind of optional subjunctive). The distal can also indicate
    obviation in instances of two referents with the same gender.
    The gender of the demonstrative pronoun must match the subject of the following subordinate clause. Likewise, the
    verb in the subordinate clause takes the subject prefix agreeing with the demonstrative pronoun, at least in theory.
    However, if the verb is directly adjacent to the demonstrative pronoun, the prefix is optional, usually dropped.
    Moreover, no object suffix is usually placed in the head clause, unless this would cause ambiguity. Thus, gender
    tracking is done largely through the demonstratives rather than verbal affixes when there are subordinate clauses.

    Relative noun clauses in Draconic are formed using correlative structures, similar to Hindi, which means you need
    both a relative pronoun and a correlative pronoun. The sentence “I love men who cook” would be structured something
    like “I love which men who cook.” Instead of just using a relative pronoun (who) to introduce the relative clause,
    we use a correlative pronoun (which) to mark the noun we are describing, and then use a relative pronoun (who) to
    introduce the relative clause. The pronouns must match in gender, though not necessarily case, as the object of the
    head clause may be the subject of the relative clause, and vice versa. Relative clauses typically follow head
    clauses, but can be shuffled around, especially to resolve animacy hierarchy issues. Correlative pronouns can
    sometimes be dropped in standalone phrases.
    The aforementioned structure is mandatory for restrictive relative clauses in Draconic, but optional for
    non-restrictive relative clauses. In such clauses, the correlative pronoun can be omitted altogether, and the
    relative pronoun then takes either the animate or inanimate plain form. Fused relatives can also be constructed in
    Draconic. Instead of using a gendered correlative before a noun, in fused relatives, an animate/inanimate plain
    correlative takes the position of the noun in the head clause. The relative pronoun functions as in non-restrictive
    relative clauses.

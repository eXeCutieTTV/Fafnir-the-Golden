    Determiners, also known as “quantifiers,” are words that specify what you're talking about (e.g. “the,” “this,”
    “those”), or that specify a quantity (e.g. “some,” “many,” “few”). For the most part, they agree in gender, but not
    in number or case. They come directly before the noun which they modify, and take their own unique set of suffixes.
    Determiners do not have declensions, and the table of determiners is available in the Dictionary (linked in
    Preface). Also note that many determiners require a certain form of the noun they describe, typically a certain
    number. This information is also in the Dictionary.
    There are four irregular determiners: the first three are the words for “the,” “this,” and “that.” Unlike the other
    determiners, these also decline for singular vs plural. The last irregular determiner is q̇e which means “no” or
    “none.” This word is unique in that it does not decline whatsoever; no matter the gender, number, or case, you
    simply put q̇e before a noun to say there is none of it.
    Draconic is reluctant to attach prepositions to determiners, and much prefers to leave such distinctions
    ambiguous/up to context. Thus, “the king of these lands,” “the king of those lands,” “the king of some lands,” “the
    king of most lands,” and “the king of all lands” can all be written as “the king of-lands.” However, in careful and
    articulate speech or to resolve ambiguity, Draconic can allow prepositions to attach to determiners.

    Determiners can also be used in this way: to say “this one” or “all of them,” one can simply say “this” or “all,”
    provided the words are inflected properly for gender. Note that such forms may be ambiguous in terms of number and
    case. The use of distal demonstratives can not only indicate physical proximity, but also social or contextual
    proximity, or even obviation. Though nominalized adjectives must follow the animacy hierarchy (see section 5.1),
    nominalized determiners do not, although both obey the presumed agency hierarchy.

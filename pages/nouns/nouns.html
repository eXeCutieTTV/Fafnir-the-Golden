        The most important thing for understanding nouns in Draconic is understanding the <strong>gender system
        </strong>. <br>Though we
        are often used to languages that use “masculine” and “feminine” as genders, that's not the only way to do it,
        and plenty of languages across the world define their grammatical genders completely independently of social
        genders. Draconic is one of those languages.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        There are <strong>7</strong> genders in Draconic, which are organized according to an <strong>animacy

        There are <strong>7</strong> genders in Draconic, which are organized according to an <strong>animacy
            hierarchy</strong>. 7 may sound like a lot,
        but genders in Draconic are much simpler than in most European languages for two reasons. <br>For one, most
        gender assignments are logical: you'll rarely have a situation where a word is classed into a gender you
        wouldn't expect. <br>Monstrous beings are in the monstrous gender, magical things are in the magical gender,
        etc. <br>Secondly, gender assignment is <strong>transparent</strong>: unlike languages like French, where

        there is often no way
        to tell what word is what gender based on its appearance other than rote memorization, in Draconic, you can
        always tell the gender of a noun based on the very last letter of the word. <br>Below is a list of the 7 genders
        in order, the abbreviation in brackets, what sorts of nouns fall into the category, and what letter the gender
        corresponds with. <br>The first four genders are collectively considered <strong>“animate</strong>,” and the

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; width: 80%;">
        Often, a single root can be classed into different genders depending on context. <br>For example, the root
        <lilitalic>qūrax</lilitalic>
        refers to things that are very tall. It can mean “altitude” in the Abstract (<lilitalic>qūraxyq̇</lilitalic>),
        “mountain” in the
        Mundane (<lilitalic>qūraxyrk</lilitalic>), “volcano” in the Magical (<lilitalic>qūraxōχ</lilitalic>), etc.
        <br>Thus, learning just a single new root often
        results
        in learning a bunch of new terms, very often with <strong>related meanings</strong> that fit the gender.

        <strong>largely productive</strong>, which means you can coin new words with it all the time. For example, you
        can usually take
        any root and put it in the Abstract to make a noun meaning the general concept of the root. So if the root
        <lilitalic>lli</lilitalic>
        means “sister,” then <lilitalic>lliq̇</lilitalic> could mean the concept/idea of a sister, or a bond between
        sisters, or sisterhood.
        <br>Even if a word is not available in the dictionary, feel free to play around and coin new words as long as:

    <p style="margin-top: 0px">
        Note that sometimes, words may historically diverge from what they originally meant, so you may end up with
        multiple definitions under the same word that don't really make sense any more. <br>The root trotry means
        <lilitalic>“giggle”</lilitalic>
        in the Abstract (<lilitalic>trotryq̇</lilitalic>), but “shark” in the Irrational (<lilitalic>trotryllūl
        </lilitalic>). These two senses seem entirely
        unrelated; however, the root trotry originally meant “toothy,” or “having many teeth.” <br>Abstractly, this was
        interpreted as showing your teeth, smiling, and eventually giggling. <br>But in the Irrational, this was taken
        to be
        a toothy animal: a shark. <br>So words that have etymological connections may have evolved to have their related
        definitions seem more opaque.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        The manifestation of each root in each gender is a little more complicated than a simple suffix. Draconic has
        four declensions, which each take different suffixes depending on the gender. <br>Every root is associated with
        a
        different declension as listed in the Dictionary. For example, the exhalted singular suffix
        can
        be -ēn, -æn, or -ħán, depending on the declension. <br>So the root <lilitalic>tutuŋ</lilitalic> is declension 3
        and becomes <lilitalic>tutuŋēn</lilitalic>,
        <br>the
        root <lilitalic>hāxær</lilitalic> is declension 2 and becomes <lilitalic>hāxæræn</lilitalic>, <br>and the root
        mân is declension 4 and becomes <lilitalic>mânħán</lilitalic>.
        <br>There is no
        rule for how to predict what declension a word will be in, though there are some <strong>generalities</strong>

        Nouns will have different forms depending on gender, number, and case. Take, for example, <lilitalic>trærūn

    <p style="width: 80%;">The primary function of the Recessive is to indicate that a word has less agency than
        would be expected of its

        struck the man.” Even though agency hierarchy suggests that the dragon should be the subject since it comes
        first in the sentence, placing the dragon in the Recessive indicates that the word has less agency than would be
        expected, so the man is presumed to be the subject instead. </p>

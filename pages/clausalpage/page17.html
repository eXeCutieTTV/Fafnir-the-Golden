    Subordinate clauses typically follow head clauses, but can precede them to resolve animacy hierarchy issues.
    Moreover, elements within a clause are typically VSO (or SVO, see section 4.2), but can be reordered for various
    reasons. However, elements within a clause cannot be pulled out of said clause. So a sentence like “(I saw) [that he
    listened to her]” (where the head clause is in parentheses and the subordinate clause is in brackets) can be
    rewritten in various ways: “that he listened to her, I saw;” “I saw that to her he listened;” “that to her he
    listened, I saw;” etc. But it could not be written as “to her, I saw that he listened,” as this would require
    pulling the prepositional phrase out of the subordinate clause.
    This can cause issues, especially with the animacy hierarchy. Consider the sentence “(the man saw) [that the mouse
    listened to the dragon].” No matter how you reorder the constituents of this sentence, it is impossible to do so in
    such a way that satisfies the animacy hierarchy. The issue is that the lowest animacy noun and the highest animacy
    noun are in the same clause, and as discussed in the previous paragraph, you cannot pull any part of a clause out,
    only reorder the items within the clause.
    More generally, if we assume three nouns (A, B, C) in decreasing animacy, sentences of the form ‘(B) [A,C]’ are
    ungrammatical. That is to say, one cannot have a clause with two nouns that differ in animacy if the sentence
    contains another noun with intermediate animacy. No matter if you try to reorder the clauses, ‘[A,C] (B)’, or if you
    try to reorder the elements of the clause, ‘(B) [C,A]’, or both, ‘[C,A] (B)’, the animacy hierarchy is still
    unsatisfied. Ideally, one would want to change the clause structure entirely: to reframe ‘(B) [A,C]’ as ‘(B,A) [C]’.
    This is exactly how Clausal Reframing works in Draconic
    Clausal Reframing is a strategy in which speakers can “front” the subject of a subordinate clause and place it as
    the object of the head clause. In the aforementioned example of “(the man saw) [that the mouse listened to the
    dragon],” this would cause the sentence to become “(the man saw the mouse) [that it listened to the dragon].” Note
    that a pronoun referring back to the fronted noun is left behind in the subordinate clause (though this is often
    just reflected in verbal conjugation or in the demonstrative itself: see section 6.2). This strategy is widespread;
    it is not only the default way of resolving the issues with aforementioned sentences, but is also generally
    performed to pull higher animacy nouns out of subordinate clauses. In fact, speakers will very rarely put nouns of
    highly differing animacy in the same clause, relying on clausal reframing to ensure ease of hierarchical
    satisfaction. Note that the head clause verb won’t take an object suffix in this situation unless it would cause
    ambiguity (see section 6.2).
    Let’s see a few examples: “(the human saw) [that the dragon listened to a mouse].” Theoretically, this would yield:
    “(tolli’ekxad tyf kālôŋlef) [sēn qħámād tyn træχonēn ōqūħcūl].” However, since this violates animacy hierarchy, we
    can perform a Clausal Reframe: “(the human saw the dragon) [that she listened to a mouse],” and thus “(tolli’ekxad
    tyf kālôŋlef tyn træχonēn) [sēn qħámād ōqūħcūl].” Finally, we can pull the dragon up front and place it in the
    recessive: “(the dragon(Rec.) saw the human) [that she listened to a mouse],” or “(tolli’ekxad tyn træχonēqân tyf
    kālôŋlef) [sēn qħámād ōqūħcūl].”
    Keep in mind that this can get quite complex, quite quickly. Dragons can perform numerous Clausal Reframes in
    succession to resolve animacy issues. Consider: “a vampire wants a human to make a mouse see a dragon eat food.”
    First, we need to parse the sentence with the proper syntax: “(a vampire wants) [that a human causes] {that a mouse
    sees} &lt;that a dragon eats food>.” Theoretically, this would give “(tôsal thutrûllīqô) [sēf χħákx kālôŋlef]
    {sēllīl
    ekx qūħcūl} &lt;lēhuχ kē træχonēn cyfoxōrk>.” First, notice that the highest and lowest animacy nouns are in the
    same clause. Let’s perform a Clausal Reframe: “(a vampire wants) [that a human causes] {that a mouse sees a
    dragon} &lt;that she eats food>.” But now, we have “mouse” and “dragon” in the same clause, which will still
    cause issues: “(a vampire wants) [that a human causes a mouse] {that it sees a dragon} &lt;that she eats
    food>.” And again, with human and mouse in the same clause, we will have issues: “(a vampire wants a
    human) [that he causes a mouse] {that it sees a dragon} &lt;that she eats food>.” Now, we can front
    human and put it in the Recessive, and reorder our clauses: “{that it sees a dragon} (a
    human(Rec.) wants a vampire) &lt;that she eats food> [that he causes a mouse],” or “{sēllīl ekx
    træχonēn} (tôsal kālôŋoqâf thutrûllīqô) &lt;lēhuχ kē cyfoxōrk> [sēf χħákx qūħcūl].” Though this
    seems incredibly hard to parse in English, remember that extensive gender tracking makes
    things a lot easier on fluent Draconic speakers: “{that(i.) sees a dragon} (a
    human(Rec.) wants(mon.) a vampire) &lt;that(e.) eats food> [that(r.) causes a mouse]. Even
    so, extensive use of Clausal Reframing like this can be a bit cognitively demanding,
    and in general parlance it is most commonly only used once in a given sentence
